# Use memory location as hex value
# Remember memory location from 0x00 to 0xFF
# Memory location will trim first, then remove all whitespaces.
# To save hex value, be sure to add 0x in front of hex value.
# To save a character, save only one character in one memory address.
# Note: Save whitespace as 0x20 HEX or 32 DEC
