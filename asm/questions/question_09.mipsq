PROMPT:
Bitwise Operation 02
(The XOR operation)
Read a value from 0x00.
Read a value from 0x01.
If bit on A is 0 and bit on B is 0, set bit to 0.
If bit on A is 1 and bit on B is 0, set bit to 1.
If bit on A is 0 and bit on B is 1, set bit to 1.
If bit on A is 1 and bit on B is 1, set bit to 0.
Save result to 0x02.
Hint: C = ((A & !B) | (!A & B))

MEMORY:
0x00:	0xACED
0x01:	0xFFFF
